giving you access to hundreds of data visualizations,

Let's start with a humble bar chart!

Let's define 3 different number sliders with 
[`st.slider`](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/api.html#streamlit.slider), 
one for each person: Alex, Brian, and Craig. These sliders are normal Streamlit  widgets, 
defined in Python. With these 3 values, we can make a bar chart, with 1 bar per person. 
We could use the standard [D3 Bar Chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/bar-chart) 
Observable notebook, but let's instead use Julien Barnier's 
[Updatable Bar Chart](https://observablehq.com/@juba/updatable-bar-chart) 
notebook, which gives nice transitions whenever the bar values change.

So we have our 3 Streamlit sliders, and we know what Observable notebook we want to use. How can we embed it?

And that's it! Try changing the `a`, `b`, or `c` sliders above, and watch how the new values automatically 
get propogated down into the notebook.

Let's quickly explain the parameters to the `observable()` function. Here is the 
[full API Reference](https://github.com/asg017/streamlit-observable#api-reference) 
for `streamlit-observable`.

The first parameter, `"Example Updatable Bar Chart"`, is the `key` parameter, used to uniquely identify every `streamlit-observable` embed. 

`notebook` is the id of the notebook at observablehq.com. You can find this at the end of the notebook's URL: 
https://observablehq.com/@juba/updatable-bar-chart

`targets` are the cells of the notebook we want to be render in the embed. In this case, we just want to 
render the SVG chart found in the `chart` cell, as well as the `draw` cell that contains the logic that 
dynmically updates the chart with new data.

`redefine` is a dict with key/values of the cells of the notebook we want to redefine, or "inject" into. 
In this case, we want to redefine the `"data"` cell, which in the original notebook is an array of JS objects,
each with `"name"` and `"value"` keys. So, we can simply hardcode the 3 names we have, pass in the `a`, `b`, and `c` 
variables we defined with `st.slider` calls, and we're good to go!

`hide` is a list of cells that we want to be ran in the embed, but not displayed. In this case, since the `"draw"` 
cell only performs logic for updating the `"chart"` SVG (and does not embed anything of interest in itself), we can 
just hide it to make our embed cleaner. Normally, unless you are dealing with animations or transitions, you don't need 
to work with the `hide` parameter much!

race is, check out the D3 [Bar Chart Race](https://observablehq.com/@d3/bar-chart-race)

First up, let's use the Wikipedia REST API to get the data. I won't go super in-depth into 
this, but if you want to learn more about all the different APIs to access Wikipedia pageview 
numbers, check out [this wiki](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Analytics/AQS/Pageviews). 

The endpoint we'll use will give us the top viewed Wikipedia articles for a given day (on desktop).
We'll grab the data starting on March 1st 2020 and ending 50 days later. The code is a little 
verbose, which you don't need to understand fully. In essence, for every day in the range we want,
we make an API request to get that day's data, we transform the schema of the data to match what 
we expect, filter out pages we don't want to see (e.g. "Main_Page"), and stuff all the day's data 
into one large pandas DataFrame.

The schema we want to match depends on the `"data"` cell in the Observable notebook. That cell
is an array of JS objects, where each object has `"date"`, `"name"`, `"category"`, and `"value"` 
keys. For this pageviews data, `"date"` will be the date that we requested, `"name"` will be 
the name of the article, `"category"` we'll just ignore (it determines the color of each bar,
which we don't need to worry about), and `"value"` will be the number of desktop views that 
page got in the given day.

Let's play with some matrices! Bryan Gin-ge Chen write a neat notebook called 
[Grid inputs](https://observablehq.com/@bryangingechen/grid-inputs), which 
gives some utility functions in Observable to render matricies in an aesthetic 
way, and allows people to change the values of a matrix very easily. Let's use 
these utilities to define a matrix in an Observable notebook embed, then read 
that matrix into Streamlit, then perform some operations on it in Python and 
pass it *back into* an Observable notebook for nice rendering!

Here's the plan: we embed 2 matricies: `a`, with 10 columns and 5 rows (10x5), 
and `b`, with 5 columns and 10 rows (5x10). Then, we read those values into 
Python numpy arrays, and use 
[`np.matmul`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.matmul.html)
to multiply `a` and `b` together. Finally, we'll embed that resulting matrix 
into *another* Observable notebook using 
[`pt()`](https://observablehq.com/d/43b57dd558b3d1ee#pt), 
a function that renders matrices into a nice $LaTeX$ format.

Let's try it out!

[Here's the notebook](https://observablehq.com/d/9e0aa2504039dbcd) we'll be embeding.
Notice how  we are importing the `"grid"` and `"pt"` cells from Bryan's 
`grid-inputs` notebook. We define 2 cells, `"viewof a"` and `"viewof b"`, which 
both use `grid()` to create matrices of different sizes (10x5 and 5x10, respectfully).
We also create a `"prettyExample"` cell, which just pretty-prints the matrix 
that's defined in the `"example"` cell. Now let's embed these into Streamlit!
